In the United States most official forms have RACE (Caucasian, Black, AmerIndian, etc.). Funny, I have a number of maps and ALL of them have fixed borders. Probably yes. So what ? Apart from Mordechai Vanunu who had a trial behind closed doors, there was one other espionage case (the nutty professor at the Nes Ziona Biological Institute who was a K.G.B. mole) who was tried \"in camera\". I wouldnt exactly call it a state secret. The trial was simply tried behind closed doors. I hate to disappoint you but the United States has tried a number of espionage cases in camera. Not Jews. Israeli citizens. Jordanian law is in effect in the West Bank but the KNESSET passed a law that Israeli law would be binding on Israeli citizens residing in the West Bank. These citizens could be Jews, Israeli Muslims, Druze, or Israeli Christians. It has NOTHING to do with religion. Anyone who was registered (Jew, Muslim, Christian) could return. You might be confusing this with the census taken in June 1967 on the West Bank after the Six Day War. In *this* instance, if the Arab was not physically present he couldnt reside on the West Bank (e.g. if he had been visting Jordan). No. Not even if you drowned him in bourbon, scotch or brandy :-) Not true. Although a minority, there *are* some Israeli Arabs living on kibbutzim. On the other hand, at my age (42) I wouldnt be admitted to a kibbutz nor could the family join me. Not that I would be so thrilled to do so in the first place. The kibbbutz movement places candidates under rigorous membership criteria. Many Israeli Jews are not admitted. The religious status quo in Israel has marriage and divorce handled by the religious courts. The RABBANUT handles marriage and divorce for Jews, the Muslim SHAARIA courts are for Muslims, the Christian denominations have their religious courts, and the Druze have their own courts. The entire religious establishment (Jewish, Muslim, Druze, Christian) wants to keep it that way. I believe its adjacent to a former Muslim cemetary. From what I heard (and Id like to get feedback from Muslins on the net) sanctity of cemetaries is not held that sancrosanct as it is held by Jews. The current Israeli Ministry of Trade and Industry on Agron Road in Jerusalem is housed in a former hotel that was built by Arabs in the 1920s on the site of an Arab cemetary. Josh backon@VMS.HUJI.AC.IL '),\n Row(news=' And I was pointing out that legal precedent defines a human being as referring only to the born, so your suggestion was incorrect. There is a confusion here about what \"bodily resources\" constitutes. Blood transfusions and organ donations involve bodily resources; your examples do not.'),\n Row(news=' And all this time I thought it was the US & Britian invading Normandy, the constant, round the clock bombing, and the fact that the Germans were fighting on two fronts. How silly of me. :) This is not to devalue the actions of the resistance movements, but resistance movements did not defeat the Nazis.

The Lebanese have not tried diplomacy for very long, or maybe theyre not capable of getting rid of the Syrians and Iranians who occupy their land.

For one, you seem unable to master your lack of desire to understand even the slightest concept of the Bible. Seems that ignorance has you mastered. How about sexual sins? Gotta any of those secret desires in your head that you harbor but can get control of? Do you dehumanize women when they walk past you? Do you degrade them to a sex object in your head? Are you the master of that kind of thinking? Do you insult people unknowingly, then regret it later. Yet do it again the next time opportunity presents itself? Are you truly the master of yourself? I have admitted that I am not the master of my thought life at all times. That I sometimes say things I do want to say, and then repeat my mistake unwantingly. I have admitted to myself that I cannot control every aspect of my being. There are times I know I shouldnt say something, but then say it anyway. There are times I simply forget a lesson. I, in fact, am not my own master. I need help. Jesus promised me this help. And I took him up on his offer. I have willfully let Jesus be my master because Jesus knows what is better for me than I myself do. And why not? Does not the creator know his creation better than the creation? Does Toyota know whats better for the Corolla than the Corolla? Then I guess ignorance is bliss for you. Because Brian, you enjoy not having a clue about the Bible.

You can choose to either live it in hell in eternal torment where there is no communication whatsoever, or can choose to live it in paradise with God. That is what my God says. And that was the issue. Your made-up theism is what it is--made up. Its wishful thinking. Is this the religion of Kendigianism? Most people are not Christian. Most people, including Christians, are not fond of feeling that they are imperfect. Is \"the world an undesireable place\" a doctrine of Kendigianism? It has nothing to do with my God. Does Kendigism have magical mystical prayers as a part of its worship? Mine doesnt. Does Kendigianism believe that the world will be holy again? Mine doesnt. Does Kendigianism also dictate that one must obey what the priest tells them like good little sheep? Mine doesnt. Is this a bunch of lies you tell yourself so that you can justify being ignorant of the Bible? Brian, following Christ has nothing to do with the doctrines of Kendigianism. You would find any of your doctrines in the Bible. I dont follow Kendigianism. I follow Christ. Also, to try to again show you your ignorance of Christ and the Bible in regards to \"priests\", have you not read about the sole Melchizedek priest in Hebrews 7 and 8? Have you not read what the purpose is of the Old Testament Levitical priesthood and why there should NOT be priests today? Yes, guess what? The Catholics messed up. I do not follow Catholicism or any \"ism.\" I follow Christ. Why would you want to live a good life? To you, you die and thats it. Dont contradict yourself. You have no reason to live a good life. It doesnt do you any good in the end. Your life doesnt do anybody else any good either because everyone dies anyway. So you have no reason to lead a good life. Leading a good life is meaningless. Why do you do such a meaningless thing? Has the resurrection sunk in? Jesus is alive. Jesus is NOT dead. Jesus was sacrified to fufill the Old Testament sacrificial system in its every detail. Jesuss death was like a seed. He needed to fall to the ground so that many new lives would take root. Did you miss the entire John passage as well? Forget that I am a person.

Mostly, that means water turning into (harmless) heavy water. But some neutrons would also hit bones, and the resulting harmfull, secondard radioactives would remain in the body for decades. I think an unshielded nuclear warhead could reasonably be considered a public health hazard. As for a shielded warhead, I think a fair amount of maintaince is required for it to remain safely shielded (e.g. storage in a dry, temperature-regulated facility, etc...) For private ownership to be unregulated, I think a single individual must be able not only to keep the weapon, but keep it in a safe condition. If any random private citizen could not properly keep, maintain and store a nuclear weapon, then some regulation is clearly appropriate. I disagree with this purpose: The job of the militia is to defend themselves and their community. If you look at the American revolution as an example, the militias won by seperating themselves from, and becoming independent of, a repressive government. They didnt overthrow it, and those communities (Canada and England, for example) that didnt defend themselves were still under that same old regime. If the role of the militia were offensive, to go out and destroy repressive governments, nuclear weapons _might_ be appropriate. But their jobs is defensive, and nuclear weapons arent suited for that. There is also the question of personal and collective arms: The Second Amendment definately protects ownership of personal weapons (since the very nature of the militia requires members to provide their own arms.) But it isnt clear if it covers other arms. Certainly, not all members would supply (for example) a tank, only a few could or (if they were to be used effectively) should. However, those providing the heavy weapons have a disproportionate control over the militia and its fierpower. The militias, as the framers envisioned them, were extremely democratic: If only 50% of the members supported the cause, only 50% would respond to a muster, and the militias firepower would be proportionately reduced. Militia firepower and the popular will were, therefore, linked. But if a small minority of the members supplied a large fraction of the firepower (in the form of heavy weapons) this would all change: The militias firepower would depend on the will of a small minority, not of the general public. Worse, that minority would be quite different from the general public (at the very least, they would be much richer.) As a result, I think the nature and character of the militia requires that each member provide a roughly equal share of the militias firepower: His personal weapons, and some equitable fraction of a squads heavier firepower.'),\n Row(news=' But why do you characterize this as a \"flight of fancy\" or a \"fantasy\"? While I am unfamiliar with the scientific context here, it appears obvious that his speculation (for lack of a better or more neutral word) was at least in significant part a consequence of his knowledge of and acceptance of current theory coupled with his observations. It would appear that something quite rational was going on as he attempted to fit his observation into that theory (or to tailor the theory to cover the observation). This does not seem like an example of what most would normally call a flight of fancy or a fantasy. Well, I think someone else in this thread was the first to use the word (also, \"extra-scientific\", etc.). Nor am I prepared to give a general account of rationality. In terms of examples, there is some danger of beginning to quibble over what a \"surprising\" experiment is, what counts as \"surprising\", etc. The same may be said about \"logical grounds\". My point is that quite frequently (perhaps even most frequently) the roots of a new theory can be traced to previously existing theories (or even to previously rejected hypotheses of some other theory or domain). I would offer some rather well known examples such as Toricellis Puy de Dome experiment done for the sake of his \"sea of air\" hypothesis. Was this theory (and the resulting experimental test) \"surprising\"? Well, given the *prior* explanations of the phenomena involved it certainly must be counted as so. Was the theory constructed (and the experiment designed) out of \"perfectly rational grounds\"? Well, there was a pretty successful and well know theory of fluids. The analogy to fluids by Toricelli is explicit. The novelty was in thinking of air as a fluid (but this was *quite* a novelty at the time). Was the theory interesting? Yes. Was it \"new\"? Well, one could argue that it was merely the extension of an existing theory to a new domain, but I think this begs certain questions.

In the United States most official forms have RACE (Caucasian, Black, AmerIndian, etc.). Funny, I have a number of maps and ALL of them have fixed borders. Probably yes. So what ? Apart from Mordechai Vanunu who had a trial behind closed doors, there was one other espionage case (the nutty professor at the Nes Ziona Biological Institute who was a K.G.B. mole) who was tried \"in camera\". I wouldnt exactly call it a state secret. The trial was simply tried behind closed doors. I hate to disappoint you but the United States has tried a number of espionage cases in camera. Not Jews. Israeli citizens. Jordanian law is in effect in the West Bank but the KNESSET passed a law that Israeli law would be binding on Israeli citizens residing in the West Bank. These citizens could be Jews, Israeli Muslims, Druze, or Israeli Christians. It has NOTHING to do with religion. Anyone who was registered (Jew, Muslim, Christian) could return. You might be confusing this with the census taken in June 1967 on the West Bank after the Six Day War. In *this* instance, if the Arab was not physically present he couldnt reside on the West Bank (e.g. if he had been visting Jordan). No. Not even if you drowned him in bourbon, scotch or brandy :-) Not true. Although a minority, there *are* some Israeli Arabs living on kibbutzim. On the other hand, at my age (42) I wouldnt be admitted to a kibbutz nor could the family join me. Not that I would be so thrilled to do so in the first place. The kibbbutz movement places candidates under rigorous membership criteria. Many Israeli Jews are not admitted. The religious status quo in Israel has marriage and divorce handled by the religious courts. The RABBANUT handles marriage and divorce for Jews, the Muslim SHAARIA courts are for Muslims, the Christian denominations have their religious courts, and the Druze have their own courts. The entire religious establishment (Jewish, Muslim, Druze, Christian) wants to keep it that way. I believe its adjacent to a former Muslim cemetary. From what I heard (and Id like to get feedback from Muslins on the net) sanctity of cemetaries is not held that sancrosanct as it is held by Jews. The current Israeli Ministry of Trade and Industry on Agron Road in Jerusalem is housed in a former hotel that was built by Arabs in the 1920s on the site of an Arab cemetary. Josh backon@VMS.HUJI.AC.IL '),\n Row(news=' And I was pointing out that legal precedent defines a human being as referring only to the born, so your suggestion was incorrect. There is a confusion here about what \"bodily resources\" constitutes. Blood transfusions and organ donations involve bodily resources; your examples do not.'),\n Row(news=' And all this time I thought it was the US & Britian invading Normandy, the constant, round the clock bombing, and the fact that the Germans were fighting on two fronts. How silly of me. :) This is not to devalue the actions of the resistance movements, but resistance movements did not defeat the Nazis.

The Lebanese have not tried diplomacy for very long, or maybe theyre not capable of getting rid of the Syrians and Iranians who occupy their land.

For one, you seem unable to master your lack of desire to understand even the slightest concept of the Bible. Seems that ignorance has you mastered. How about sexual sins? Gotta any of those secret desires in your head that you harbor but can get control of? Do you dehumanize women when they walk past you? Do you degrade them to a sex object in your head? Are you the master of that kind of thinking? Do you insult people unknowingly, then regret it later. Yet do it again the next time opportunity presents itself? Are you truly the master of yourself? I have admitted that I am not the master of my thought life at all times. That I sometimes say things I do want to say, and then repeat my mistake unwantingly. I have admitted to myself that I cannot control every aspect of my being. There are times I know I shouldnt say something, but then say it anyway. There are times I simply forget a lesson. I, in fact, am not my own master. I need help. Jesus promised me this help. And I took him up on his offer. I have willfully let Jesus be my master because Jesus knows what is better for me than I myself do. And why not? Does not the creator know his creation better than the creation? Does Toyota know whats better for the Corolla than the Corolla? Then I guess ignorance is bliss for you. Because Brian, you enjoy not having a clue about the Bible.

You can choose to either live it in hell in eternal torment where there is no communication whatsoever, or can choose to live it in paradise with God. That is what my God says. And that was the issue. Your made-up theism is what it is--made up. Its wishful thinking. Is this the religion of Kendigianism? Most people are not Christian. Most people, including Christians, are not fond of feeling that they are imperfect. Is \"the world an undesireable place\" a doctrine of Kendigianism? It has nothing to do with my God. Does Kendigism have magical mystical prayers as a part of its worship? Mine doesnt. Does Kendigianism believe that the world will be holy again? Mine doesnt. Does Kendigianism also dictate that one must obey what the priest tells them like good little sheep? Mine doesnt. Is this a bunch of lies you tell yourself so that you can justify being ignorant of the Bible? Brian, following Christ has nothing to do with the doctrines of Kendigianism. You would find any of your doctrines in the Bible. I dont follow Kendigianism. I follow Christ. Also, to try to again show you your ignorance of Christ and the Bible in regards to \"priests\", have you not read about the sole Melchizedek priest in Hebrews 7 and 8? Have you not read what the purpose is of the Old Testament Levitical priesthood and why there should NOT be priests today? Yes, guess what? The Catholics messed up. I do not follow Catholicism or any \"ism.\" I follow Christ. Why would you want to live a good life? To you, you die and thats it. Dont contradict yourself. You have no reason to live a good life. It doesnt do you any good in the end. Your life doesnt do anybody else any good either because everyone dies anyway. So you have no reason to lead a good life. Leading a good life is meaningless. Why do you do such a meaningless thing? Has the resurrection sunk in? Jesus is alive. Jesus is NOT dead. Jesus was sacrified to fufill the Old Testament sacrificial system in its every detail. Jesuss death was like a seed. He needed to fall to the ground so that many new lives would take root. Did you miss the entire John passage as well? Forget that I am a person.

Mostly, that means water turning into (harmless) heavy water. But some neutrons would also hit bones, and the resulting harmfull, secondard radioactives would remain in the body for decades. I think an unshielded nuclear warhead could reasonably be considered a public health hazard. As for a shielded warhead, I think a fair amount of maintaince is required for it to remain safely shielded (e.g. storage in a dry, temperature-regulated facility, etc...) For private ownership to be unregulated, I think a single individual must be able not only to keep the weapon, but keep it in a safe condition. If any random private citizen could not properly keep, maintain and store a nuclear weapon, then some regulation is clearly appropriate. I disagree with this purpose: The job of the militia is to defend themselves and their community. If you look at the American revolution as an example, the militias won by seperating themselves from, and becoming independent of, a repressive government. They didnt overthrow it, and those communities (Canada and England, for example) that didnt defend themselves were still under that same old regime. If the role of the militia were offensive, to go out and destroy repressive governments, nuclear weapons _might_ be appropriate. But their jobs is defensive, and nuclear weapons arent suited for that. There is also the question of personal and collective arms: The Second Amendment definately protects ownership of personal weapons (since the very nature of the militia requires members to provide their own arms.) But it isnt clear if it covers other arms. Certainly, not all members would supply (for example) a tank, only a few could or (if they were to be used effectively) should. However, those providing the heavy weapons have a disproportionate control over the militia and its fierpower. The militias, as the framers envisioned them, were extremely democratic: If only 50% of the members supported the cause, only 50% would respond to a muster, and the militias firepower would be proportionately reduced. Militia firepower and the popular will were, therefore, linked. But if a small minority of the members supplied a large fraction of the firepower (in the form of heavy weapons) this would all change: The militias firepower would depend on the will of a small minority, not of the general public. Worse, that minority would be quite different from the general public (at the very least, they would be much richer.) As a result, I think the nature and character of the militia requires that each member provide a roughly equal share of the militias firepower: His personal weapons, and some equitable fraction of a squads heavier firepower.'),\n Row(news=' But why do you characterize this as a \"flight of fancy\" or a \"fantasy\"? While I am unfamiliar with the scientific context here, it appears obvious that his speculation (for lack of a better or more neutral word) was at least in significant part a consequence of his knowledge of and acceptance of current theory coupled with his observations. It would appear that something quite rational was going on as he attempted to fit his observation into that theory (or to tailor the theory to cover the observation). This does not seem like an example of what most would normally call a flight of fancy or a fantasy. Well, I think someone else in this thread was the first to use the word (also, \"extra-scientific\", etc.). Nor am I prepared to give a general account of rationality. In terms of examples, there is some danger of beginning to quibble over what a \"surprising\" experiment is, what counts as \"surprising\", etc. The same may be said about \"logical grounds\". My point is that quite frequently (perhaps even most frequently) the roots of a new theory can be traced to previously existing theories (or even to previously rejected hypotheses of some other theory or domain). I would offer some rather well known examples such as Toricellis Puy de Dome experiment done for the sake of his \"sea of air\" hypothesis. Was this theory (and the resulting experimental test) \"surprising\"? Well, given the *prior* explanations of the phenomena involved it certainly must be counted as so. Was the theory constructed (and the experiment designed) out of \"perfectly rational grounds\"? Well, there was a pretty successful and well know theory of fluids. The analogy to fluids by Toricelli is explicit. The novelty was in thinking of air as a fluid (but this was *quite* a novelty at the time). Was the theory interesting? Yes. Was it \"new\"? Well, one could argue that it was merely the extension of an existing theory to a new domain, but I think this begs certain questions.
