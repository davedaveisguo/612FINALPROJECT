Iam arguing about : the Armenian-Nazi colaboration during World War II. Any comment? It could be, perhaps, your head wasnt screwed on just right. In 1941, while the Jews were being assembled for their doom in the Nazi concentration camps, the Armenian volunteers in Germany formed the first Armenian battalion to fight alongside the Nazis. In 1943, this battalion had grown into eight battalions of 20,000-strong under the command of the former guerilla leader Dro (the butcher), who was the former dictator of the short-lived Armenian Dictatorship (1918-1920) and the architect of the cold-blooded genocide of 2.5 million Turks and Kurds between 1914-1920. An Armenian National Council was formed by the notorious Dashnak Party leaders in Berlin, which was recognized by the Nazis. Encouraged by this, the Armenians summarily formed a provisional government that endorsed and espoused fully the principles of the Nazis and declared themselves as the members of the Aryan super race and full participants to Hitlers policy of extermination of the Jews. This Armenian-Nazi conspiracy against the Jews during WWII was an \"encore\" performance staged by the Armenians during WWI, when they back-stabbed and exterminated 2.5 million Turks by colluding with the invading Russian army. Furthermore, as McCarthy put it, the Armenian dictatorship was granted a respite when the Ottomans admitted defeat and signed the Mudros Armistice with the Allies (October 30, 1918). The Allies had decided to create a Greater Armenia, including the old Russian province of Yerevan and adjoining areas, as well as most parts of Anatolia claimed by the Armenian fanatics. Only the area called Cilicia (around the Ottoman province of Adana) was to be excluded, as it had already been claimed by the French. The Allies quickly set about attempting to disarm Ottoman soldiers and other Turks, who could be expected to oppose their plans. On April 19, 1919 the British Army occupied Kars, gave civilian and military power over to the Armenians, then withdrew. The British planned for Kars to be included in the Armenian Dictatorship, even though the Russian pre-war census had shown Kars Province to be over 60% Muslim. The Turks of Kars were effectively disarmed, but the British could not disarm the Kurds of the mountains. The fate of the Turks was almost an exact replica of what had occurred earlier in Eastern Anatolia. Murder, pillage, genocide and the destruction of Turkish homes and entire Turkish villages drove the Turks of Kars to the mountains or south and west to the safety afforded by remaining units of the Ottoman Army. The British had left the scene to the Armenian genocide squads. Therefore, few Europeans were present to observe the genocide. One British soldier, Colonel Rawlinson, who was assigned to supervise the disarmament of Otoman soldiers, saw what was occurring. Rawlinson wired to his superiors, \"in the interest of humanity the Armenians should not be left in independent command of the Moslim population, as, their troops being without discipline and not being under effective control, atrocities were constantly being committed.\" Come again? : \"These European Dashnags, with headquarters in Berlin, appealed to...

Syria and Lebanon have a right to determine if they wish to return to the situation prior to the French invasion where they were both part of the same \"mandate territory\" - read colony. Israel has no right to determine what happens in Lebanon. Invading another country because you consider them a threat is precisely the way that almost all wars of aggression have started. Again territorial expansion by force. The UN defines them as occupied. They are recognised as such by every nation on earth (excluding one small caribean island). So the Adam thinks that peace is possible with continued occupation and a continued military presence? That is a completely unsustainable situation because the USA is bankrupt and simply cannot afford to finance the Israeli ecconomy any more. There is no money for such an occupation. They were moved in as part of a deliberate policy to prevent the return of the occupied territories. Machiavelli described the reasoning in the Prince. The clear intention was to create a constituency which the Likud beleived could not be deprived of the land stolen from the indigenous population. The pretexts under which the settlers aquired land was through the redefinition of much land used in common as \"public land\". The assertion that the village common on which the village depends for food belongs to an invader simply because no individual has title is clearly an excuse. When the land is used to build a condominium for aliens brought in to occupy the land for a foreign power there is a clear breach of the Geneva convention which stipulates that land use in occupied territories must not be changed. No amount of self justifying on the part of Likud and hard linner appologists will change the fact that the majority of world governments, and all of those that actually have any power have condemned this practice. Theyu also are a liability. We are talking about civilian encampments that would last no more than hours against tanks, Dont fool yourself. It was the gulf war that brought the Israelis to the negotiating table. Once their US backers had a secure base in the gulf they insrtructed Shamir to negotiate or else. If the creation of settlements had gone on any longer the USA would have cut the money supply. Not at all. They can chose to live in an arab state or return to Israel. The existence of a comunity does not give the right for another country to annexe territory, not in Bosnia, not in the West Bank. Unless the new boundaries drawn up are those of 48 there will be no peace. Araffat has precious little authority to agree to anything else. The real issue is not the land treaty but the trade treaty. Since the Palestinians will remain heavily dependent on Israel indefinitely it is this that will be the guarantor of peace. another factor will be the return of lands confiscated by the Israeli state within Israel and the dismantling of the shadow structures which allow discrimination against non-Jews within what is nominaly a secular state.

Both Type 1 and TT fonts can be of excellent quality and poor quality at any size. It all depends on the fonts maker and the complexity of the glyphs related to the size and resolution at which they are viewed. Probably the reason for your opinion/experience that TT is inferior is because most TT fonts on the market today have been converted from Type 1 outlines to TT either by the font vendor or end-users using Fontographer or FontMonger instead of the TT fonts being hand-hinted to take advantage of the TT hinting language. At best these converted TT fonts will be on a par with the Type 1 font of its orgin. TrueType is a much richer and more robust hinting language than Type 1 (the hinting of diagonals for instance, which TT does and Type 1 cannot). If you check out the Windows 3.1 core fonts (Times, Arial, Courier, Symbol, Wingdings) youll see what can be done with TT. There are other fonts out there that have been hand-hinted and not just converted. Some of the Microsoft TT Font Pack 2 fonts are hinted very well. Again, not true. The characters in a TT or Type 1 font depend on the maker. If someone converts a Type 1 font to TT theyll only get the characters in the font of orgin. TT allows for much more flexibility in this area as well. You can have thousands of glyphs in a TT font file (Mac/PS/Windows/Unicode char set) and use the characters appropriate for the particular platform you are running the font on. For instance, all or our fontpack 2 TT fonts have the Mac/Windows char set in them. The metrics of the fonts are such that if the font is brought over to the mac the user will have access to the full mac char set. Hope this clears up some of the confusion.

And the final standings were: W L GB St. Louis 93 69 - Philadelphia 92 70 1 Cincinnati 92 70 1 San Francisco 90 72 3 Now it doesnt appear to me that Phillies pitchers Bunning and Short were really overused, at least by the four-man rotation standard of the day, until well along into the 10-game losing streak, at which time Mauch was probably desperate for a win at any cost because the Phillies substantial lead had evaporated. The way they were used at that time may have made the problem worse, although Bunning had one of his sharpest games of the year in the final day 10-0 shutout of the Reds that cost the Reds a share of the pennant. Bunning pitched a complete game six-hitter, striking out five and walking one. It would be inetersting to see, though, how the total innings for the year for Bunning and Short stacks up against the rest of the league. Also notice that the Phillies played every day from at least September 1 through October 1; while they didnt play substantially more games than the other teams, the other teams each had a couple days off during that stretch.

It would have the plus of RocketShare and the minus of NuBus accelerators - no true boot off the accelerator, NuBus bottleneck to video and other I/O. Apple, it seems, will not compete with third parties here -- except perhaps for not-yet-available Macs like Cyclone, where a PowerPC slot might be advertised. Look for Daystar and such to make PowerPC accelerators. One potential problem with any accelerator, though, is that it will need a ROM companion and Apple has licensed only Radius, with Rocketshare, to use any of its proprietary code. Apple is, between the lines, trying to let us know that PowerPC Macs will have simplified logic boards due to the magical nature of RISC and that these boards should be much cheaper to build than those in existing 68040 Macs. Perhaps, then, well see groundbreaking prices in Mac-logic board upgrades, much the same way weve seen much cheaper high-performance CPUs this year. First generation PowerPCs, 98601s, will also hopefully have socketed CPUs so that theyll be chip upgradeable to 98604s a year later. This should be possible in much the same way that 486s can be pulled for clock doublers. If there is too much technical baggage (which I doubt since the external busses are the same size/width) to do this, perhaps we can have CPU daughterboard, a la Powerbook, as standard to facilitate better CPU upgrades. This is an area where Apple has fallen far behing the Intel-based world. Perhaps catchup is in order.

Intels market position will never again be as dominant as it is today (especially if AMD gets the go ahead to sell its 486s this week as it appears it might).

The atrocities committed by the Armenian volunteer forces accompanying the Russian army were so severe that the Russian commanders themselves were compelled to withdraw them from the fighting fronts and sent them to rear guard duties.

Iam arguing about : the Armenian-Nazi colaboration during World War II. Any comment? It could be, perhaps, your head wasnt screwed on just right. In 1941, while the Jews were being assembled for their doom in the Nazi concentration camps, the Armenian volunteers in Germany formed the first Armenian battalion to fight alongside the Nazis. In 1943, this battalion had grown into eight battalions of 20,000-strong under the command of the former guerilla leader Dro (the butcher), who was the former dictator of the short-lived Armenian Dictatorship (1918-1920) and the architect of the cold-blooded genocide of 2.5 million Turks and Kurds between 1914-1920. An Armenian National Council was formed by the notorious Dashnak Party leaders in Berlin, which was recognized by the Nazis. Encouraged by this, the Armenians summarily formed a provisional government that endorsed and espoused fully the principles of the Nazis and declared themselves as the members of the Aryan super race and full participants to Hitlers policy of extermination of the Jews. This Armenian-Nazi conspiracy against the Jews during WWII was an \"encore\" performance staged by the Armenians during WWI, when they back-stabbed and exterminated 2.5 million Turks by colluding with the invading Russian army. Furthermore, as McCarthy put it, the Armenian dictatorship was granted a respite when the Ottomans admitted defeat and signed the Mudros Armistice with the Allies (October 30, 1918). The Allies had decided to create a Greater Armenia, including the old Russian province of Yerevan and adjoining areas, as well as most parts of Anatolia claimed by the Armenian fanatics. Only the area called Cilicia (around the Ottoman province of Adana) was to be excluded, as it had already been claimed by the French. The Allies quickly set about attempting to disarm Ottoman soldiers and other Turks, who could be expected to oppose their plans. On April 19, 1919 the British Army occupied Kars, gave civilian and military power over to the Armenians, then withdrew. The British planned for Kars to be included in the Armenian Dictatorship, even though the Russian pre-war census had shown Kars Province to be over 60% Muslim. The Turks of Kars were effectively disarmed, but the British could not disarm the Kurds of the mountains. The fate of the Turks was almost an exact replica of what had occurred earlier in Eastern Anatolia. Murder, pillage, genocide and the destruction of Turkish homes and entire Turkish villages drove the Turks of Kars to the mountains or south and west to the safety afforded by remaining units of the Ottoman Army. The British had left the scene to the Armenian genocide squads. Therefore, few Europeans were present to observe the genocide. One British soldier, Colonel Rawlinson, who was assigned to supervise the disarmament of Otoman soldiers, saw what was occurring. Rawlinson wired to his superiors, \"in the interest of humanity the Armenians should not be left in independent command of the Moslim population, as, their troops being without discipline and not being under effective control, atrocities were constantly being committed.\" Come again? : \"These European Dashnags, with headquarters in Berlin, appealed to...

Syria and Lebanon have a right to determine if they wish to return to the situation prior to the French invasion where they were both part of the same \"mandate territory\" - read colony. Israel has no right to determine what happens in Lebanon. Invading another country because you consider them a threat is precisely the way that almost all wars of aggression have started. Again territorial expansion by force. The UN defines them as occupied. They are recognised as such by every nation on earth (excluding one small caribean island). So the Adam thinks that peace is possible with continued occupation and a continued military presence? That is a completely unsustainable situation because the USA is bankrupt and simply cannot afford to finance the Israeli ecconomy any more. There is no money for such an occupation. They were moved in as part of a deliberate policy to prevent the return of the occupied territories. Machiavelli described the reasoning in the Prince. The clear intention was to create a constituency which the Likud beleived could not be deprived of the land stolen from the indigenous population. The pretexts under which the settlers aquired land was through the redefinition of much land used in common as \"public land\". The assertion that the village common on which the village depends for food belongs to an invader simply because no individual has title is clearly an excuse. When the land is used to build a condominium for aliens brought in to occupy the land for a foreign power there is a clear breach of the Geneva convention which stipulates that land use in occupied territories must not be changed. No amount of self justifying on the part of Likud and hard linner appologists will change the fact that the majority of world governments, and all of those that actually have any power have condemned this practice. Theyu also are a liability. We are talking about civilian encampments that would last no more than hours against tanks, Dont fool yourself. It was the gulf war that brought the Israelis to the negotiating table. Once their US backers had a secure base in the gulf they insrtructed Shamir to negotiate or else. If the creation of settlements had gone on any longer the USA would have cut the money supply. Not at all. They can chose to live in an arab state or return to Israel. The existence of a comunity does not give the right for another country to annexe territory, not in Bosnia, not in the West Bank. Unless the new boundaries drawn up are those of 48 there will be no peace. Araffat has precious little authority to agree to anything else. The real issue is not the land treaty but the trade treaty. Since the Palestinians will remain heavily dependent on Israel indefinitely it is this that will be the guarantor of peace. another factor will be the return of lands confiscated by the Israeli state within Israel and the dismantling of the shadow structures which allow discrimination against non-Jews within what is nominaly a secular state. The irony is that in return for a guarantee that the palestinian state has a non descrimination law in order to protect the remaining settlers the Israeli state is going to be forced inot the same position. This will mean outlawing of discrimination such as that which prevents arabs from buying or using much of the land.

The way they were used at that time may have made the problem worse, although Bunning had one of his sharpest games of the year in the final day 10-0 shutout of the Reds that cost the Reds a share of the pennant. Bunning pitched a complete game six-hitter, striking out five and walking one. It would be inetersting to see, though, how the total innings for the year for Bunning and Short stacks up against the rest of the league. Also notice that the Phillies played every day from at least September 1 through October 1; while they didnt play substantially more games than the other teams, the other teams each had a couple days off during that stretch.

So from our point of view, when they are brought out into the public, they are being trampled under feet, because of misinterpretations and mocking, and it is therefore offensive to us.

It would have the plus of RocketShare and the minus of NuBus accelerators - no true boot off the accelerator, NuBus bottleneck to video and other I/O. Apple, it seems, will not compete with third parties here -- except perhaps for not-yet-available Macs like Cyclone, where a PowerPC slot might be advertised. Look for Daystar and such to make PowerPC accelerators. One potential problem with any accelerator, though, is that it will need a ROM companion and Apple has licensed only Radius, with Rocketshare, to use any of its proprietary code. Apple is, between the lines, trying to let us know that PowerPC Macs will have simplified logic boards due to the magical nature of RISC and that these boards should be much cheaper to build than those in existing 68040 Macs. Perhaps, then, well see groundbreaking prices in Mac-logic board upgrades, much the same way weve seen much cheaper high-performance CPUs this year. First generation PowerPCs, 98601s, will also hopefully have socketed CPUs so that theyll be chip upgradeable to 98604s a year later. This should be possible in much the same way that 486s can be pulled for clock doublers. If there is too much technical baggage (which I doubt since the external busses are the same size/width) to do this, perhaps we can have CPU daughterboard, a la Powerbook, as standard to facilitate better CPU upgrades. This is an area where Apple has fallen far behing the Intel-based world. Perhaps catchup is in order. By the way, last weeks PC week had an excellent story on PowerPC, Pentium, MIPS R4000, DEC Alpha (the big four on the microprocessor front for the forseeable future). Worth reading for technojunkies. Also, the latest PC has a cover story on Pentium. Read it, and all the other stories about how Intel is unstoppable and preeminent right now. Once anyone is this secure, they are due to fall. Intels market position will never again be as dominant as it is today (especially if AMD gets the go ahead to sell its 486s this week as it appears it might). The competition from all fronts is gearing up for an awesome battle. Apple users should be excited that PowerPC, while not guaranteed dominance, is a guaranteed winner, even if its one of several.'),\n Row(news=' Reading this definition, I wonder: when should you recognize something as being a \"mistake\"?

(Though I am now unsure what that sentence does mean.) You implied that anyone who wants to send troops to Bosnia wants to do so to help the \"butchers of their choice\". Since the primary targets of help are Muslim victims of \"ethnic cleansing\", you imply that such Muslim victims are butchers. This implies both sides are equal. True, it may sometimes be difficult or impossible to determine which side is the victim, but that does not mean that victims do not exist. Would you, in WWII have said that there were atrocities on the sides of both the Jews and the Germans? Yes, but both sides want different things. The Muslims chiefly want to not be \"ethnic cleansed\". The Serbians want to \"ethnic cleanse\" the Muslims. It is indeed true that each side will stop when it gets what it wants, but the things that the two sides want are not equivalent. I recall, before we did anything for Somalia, (apparent) left-wingers saying that the reason everyone was more willing to send troops to Bosnia than to Somalia was because the Somalis are third-worlders who Americans consider unworthy of help. They suddenly shut up when the US decided to send troops to the opposite place than that predicted by the theory. For that matter, this theory of yours suggests that Americans should want to help the Serbs. After all, theyre Christian, and the Muslims are not. If the desire to intervene in Bosnia is based on racism against people that are less like us, why does everyone _want_ to help the side that _is_ less like us?
